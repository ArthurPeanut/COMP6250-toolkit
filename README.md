# Stakeholder Analyzer for COMP-6250

This project was designed to analyze the stakeholder on two dimensions, which are interest and power.\
You can get your analysis once you commit your survey answers.\
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
And this is my first React App.\
Hope you enjoy!
