# Stakeholder Analyzer for COMP-6250
Author:Haoqing Liu (ANU)

This project was designed to analyze the stakeholder on two dimensions, which are interest and power.\
You can get your analysis once you commit your survey answers.\
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
And this is my first React App.\
Hope you enjoy!

As you get ready, time to start the survey!

### Forms page

Here we start the survey. \
We carefully designed the questions to measure your interest and power on your project. \
For convenience, you can answer the questions rating on the scale of 1-5.

Apparently, you have both high power and interest on your project! \
As a responsible stakeholder, why don't you manage your project closely? \

### Details on design

Our measurement is inspired by this figure:

Apart from the result with both high power and interest, we also have results for other situations: \
If you are effected little, and at the same time pay little attention to the project, \
you are likely to get such result:

And results on other situations(high power & low interest, low power & high interest):
